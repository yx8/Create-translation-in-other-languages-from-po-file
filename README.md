# Create-translation-in-other-languages-from-po-file

What to do if you only have a .po file and you want to create new .po files for translating other language?

The easiest way is here. 


For example if we only happen to get a fr_FR.po file which is the French translation file, but we don't have the translation template .pot file. And we want to create new language translations, such as a zh_CN.po file for Chinese translation.

- First rename the `fr_FR.po` file extension from "po" to "pot".


- Open the renamed file "fr_FR.pot" with Poedit.


- Create new translation in the Poedit software and save it as a new .po file.


That's it, an easy tip to create new .po files if you don't have the .pot template. 


Hope this could help you when you don't have the .pot template file.
